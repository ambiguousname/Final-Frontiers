The Aratel Situation - Your Orders

In terms of priority, you are to:

1. Escort Ambassador G'Vorik to the Aratel System

2. Do whatever you can to make sure talks between the Aratel and the Augurs go as peacefully and as smoothly as possible.

What follows is a brief report and analysis of the Aratel:

The Aratel homeworld of Yvik was first discovered on 1845.9.0, having just reached development comparable to the iron-age. They are bipedal humanoids. Average life expectancy, when last surveyed, amounted to 20 years on average.

They continued to progress normally until about a hundred years ago, where Union probes discovered they had fully mastered space flight and conventional weaponry. 

Reasons for technological leap are unknown.

Presently, the Aratel have been ruled by a social strata known as "Augurs". They worship the Augurs as gods and follow a set of strict principles called the Word of the Augurs.

Recently, the Aratel have been claiming mistreatment by Augurs. Both parties have requested the Union specifically as a neutral party to mediate the dispute. They are somewhat strange as space-farers go, especially with their rapid advancement. They generally do not leave their space, and do not share details on the inner-workings of their society. We only have snippets of information about how the Aratel currently function, but the prevailing theory is that the Aratel have managed to access and use technology well past their developmental level.
