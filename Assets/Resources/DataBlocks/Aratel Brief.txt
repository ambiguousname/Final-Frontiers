The Aratel Situation - Your Orders

In terms of priority, you are to:

1. Escort Ambassador G'Vorik to the Aratel System

2. Do whatever you can to make sure talks between the Aratel and the Augurs go as peacefully and as smoothly as possible.

What follows is a brief report and analysis of the Aratel:

The Aratel were first discovered on 1845.9.0, having just developed iron tools.

They seemed to progress normally until about a hundred years ago, where Union probes discovered they had fully mastered space flight and conventional weaponry. 

Reasons for technological leap are unknown. 

For the past few hundred years, the Aratel have been ruled by a social strata known as "Augurs".

Recently, the Aratel have been claiming mistreatment by Augurs. Both parties have requested the Union specifically as a neutral party to mediate the dispute.

The Aratel are somewhat strange as space-farers go, especially with their rapid advancement.

The Aratel generally do not leave their space, and do not share details on the inner-workings of their society.

We only have snippets of information about how the Aratel currently function, but the prevailing theory is that the Aratel have managed to access use of technology well past their developmental level.

This has naturally been very harmful to their expected development.
