Officer Dabo: Captain, I'm detecting two opposing Aratel fleets. Neither of them appear to be moving.
Officer Dabo: One flagship claims to be hailing from the "New Movement fleet", while the other is dead silent.

            Ambassador G'Vorik: Apologies, Ratet Hud. It is good to meet you, despite our first impressions.

    Ratet Hud: Union ship, we are here to negotiate. We do not appreciate percieved hostilities.
    <<if $gvorikStatus == "independent">>
        Ratet Hud: We appreciate the apology.
    <<endif>>
    Ratet Hud: We can forgive transgressions in return for your aid.

Ratet Hud: I will make this simple, Captain. The Augurs of the other ship refuse to communicate with us.
<<if $newMovementPOC == "gvorik">>
    Ratet Hud: We are only interested in peace, Ambassador.
<<else>>
    Ratet Hud: We are only interested in peace, Captain.
<<endif>>
Ratet Hud: If the Augurs do not wish to speak with us, then we cannot make peace.

-> You: We will do everything we can to ensure peace between your peoples.
-> You: Understood.
-> You: Who needs peace, anyways?
    <<set $newMovementOpinion to $newMovementOpinion - 5>>
    Ratet Hud: I see.

Ratet Hud: Anything else I can do for you, Captain?
-> You: What can you tell me about yourselves?
    Ratet Hud: We are the New Movement.
    -> You: Is that it?
    -> You: Okay...
    -> You: Your movement name is very creative. A+, no explanation necessary.
    Ratet Hud: ... I am trying to think of a way to summarize ourselves.
    Ratet Hud: The New Movement is representative of all Aratel. 100 years ago, the Augurs claimed they would lead us to salvation.
    Ratet Hud: But it was a lie. We are forced to comply with every demand, and while we have made many advances, it was at the cost of our own freedom.
    Ratet Hud: We would like the ability to govern ourselves.
    <<jump NewMovementDiscussion>>
-> You: What can you tell me about the Augurs?
    Ratet Hud: They are our ruling class. They tend not to concern themselves with our day to day lives.
    Ratet Hud: Which is exactly why they are so ineffective and callous.
    Ratet Hud: It is beyond their capabilities to care. I am surprised they even agreed to negotiate.
    Ratet Hud: But now, they shoot at us if we get too close.
    <<jump NewMovementDiscussion>>
-> You: Are you aware that your Homeworld is missing an entire continent? <<if hasInfo("Yvik")>>
    Ratet Hud: Yvik's Eye. Yes, I am aware.
    Ratet Hud: We'll transfer the relevant information into your databanks.
    Ratet Hud: Standby for transmission.
    Officer Dabo: Transmission recieved. Data block added to your data pad, Captain.

    Ratet Hud: *Lesser* Augur Morrigor?
    Ratet Hud: How DARE they. Captain, the Augurs are refusing to seriously consider our offer.
    Ratet Hud: *Lesser* Augur Morrigor is nothing more than a... a dog, blindly obeying their commands.
    Ratet Hud: We WILL NOT negotiate unless we can speak to the Augurs themselves.
    -> You: My first priority is just to get Morrigor to agree to talks. Demands can come after.
    -> You: Understood.
    -> You: Whiners. Be grateful that they sent someone at all.

            Ambassador G'Vorik: Great Augurs, we're here to negotiate peace and resolve your conflict.
        <<endif>>
    <<endif>>

Morrigor: I don't care. But you may call me Morrigor. And the Augurs don't need your involvement.
Morrigor: Take your Union ship, use your human urethras to wet yourselves, and go.

-> You: I'm willing to ignore your blatant insult in the interest of peace, Morrigor.
    Morrigor: You are far more forgiving than I would ever be.
    Morrigor: I guess the Union *is* full of peace-loving simpletons.
-> You: You're excluding a lot of other species that work on this ship.
    Morrigor: They can "pee" themselves in whatever manner they choose. I imagine you could "pee" yourself easily, though.
    Morrigor: Seeing as how you are a human.
-> You: Oh yeah? Well why don't YOU wet YOURSELVES?
    Morrigor: Perhaps I am too busy engaging in coitus with your mother. And your father.

Morrigor: Offscreen.

Commander Corwin: I didn't know anyone was allowed to hang up on us.
Officer Dabo: They agreed to negotiations. Why would they be so dismissive?

<<if $gvorikStatus == "onBridge">>
    Ambassador G'Vorik: It's strange. They're purposefully trying to jeopardize whatever chance at peace they could have.
    Ambassador G'Vorik: I'm not sure why, though.
