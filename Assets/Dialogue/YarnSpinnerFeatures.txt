Just a list of features for Yarn spinner that I'd like. Maybe I'll fork the relevant repositories and add these someday.

For Yarn:
Arrays and iterables (especially from external scripts)

For the VS Code Plugin:
Outline for all variables and all of their possible values (+ options to filter based on things like what yarn file you're currently in)
If above is done fully and successfully, a testing framework built on top for testing whether or not the player can access certain branches or nodes with certain conditions from a given starting node.
Highlight a section of text and make a new node from it (and replace the section with a jump marker)
Auto-indent on new line.
